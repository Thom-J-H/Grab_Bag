This repo collects all the notebooks (& related scripts) that add up to no greater whole or theme, but that I do not (yet) wish to throw away. In reverse chronological order.

## Exploring Student Height (the Central Limit Theorem)

In Spring 2021, I taught a course entitled “Telling Stories with Data” (TSD), which introduced non-STEM majors to the Tidyverse and basic data visualization and analysis. I had bright students, but ones who typically had NO prior experience with either statistical analysis or computer programming. So TSD was designed as a soft entry, beginner-level guide to working with data. One early part of the course involved the students learning about distributions, including the normal distribution and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). To help them explore the normal distribution and the CLT, I made some custom graphing functions (that process described in this markdown). We used these in our class. The custom functions, their associated data, and the related RMD and script freely available here.  The RMDs published also at Rpubs:
